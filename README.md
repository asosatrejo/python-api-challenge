## Part 1: WeatherPy
### Create Plots to Showcase the Relationship Between Weather Variables and Latitude
A series of scatter plots are created to showcase the following relationships:
- Latitude vs. Temperature
- Latitude vs. Humidity
- Latitude vs. Cloudiness
- Latitude vs. Wind Speed
### Compute Linear Regression for Each Relationship
First, we must compute the linear regression for each relationship. Next, create a series of scatter plots.
- Northern Hemisphere: Temperature vs. Latitude
- Southern Hemisphere: Temperature vs. Latitude
- Northern Hemisphere: Humidity vs. Latitude
- Southern Hemisphere: Humidity vs. Latitude
- Northern Hemisphere: Cloudiness vs. Latitude
- Southern Hemisphere: Cloudiness vs. Latitude
- Northern Hemisphere: Wind Speed vs. Latitude
- Southern Hemisphere: Wind Speed vs. Latitude
After each pair of plots, we will explain what the linear regression is modeling and describe any relationships / other findings we may uncover.

## Part 1: VacationPy
- Create a map that displays a point for every city in the city_data_df DataFrame
- Narrow down the city_data_df DataFrame to find your ideal weather condition
- For each city in the hotel_df DataFrame, use the Geoapify API to find the first hotel located within 10,000 metres of your coordinates
- Add the hotel name and the country as additional information in the hover message for each city in the map
